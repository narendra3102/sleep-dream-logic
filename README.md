💤 Sleep-Dream Logic Mapper
The World’s First Personal Cognitive Performance Optimizer
📌 Overview

The Sleep-Dream Logic Mapper is a predictive software system that discovers the hidden connection between your sleep patterns and your decision-making abilities.

Unlike traditional sleep trackers that only tell you “You slept 7 hours,” this tool predicts:

👉 “Based on your sleep last night, your creativity will peak between 9–11 AM today, but avoid financial decisions until after 3 PM.”

🎯 Problem Statement

People make critical decisions without knowing their biological readiness.

Current sleep apps focus on duration and quality, not on cognitive impact.

Billions of poor decisions are made daily due to timing ignorance.

💡 Solution

Sleep-Dream Logic Mapper creates a personalized cognitive weather forecast:

Uses sleep data + lifestyle factors (sleep hours, REM %, deep sleep %, interruptions, stress, caffeine, screen time).

Applies machine learning models to predict decision-making readiness.

Provides time-based recommendations for analytical, creative, emotional, social, and financial decisions.

🔬 How It Works

Data Collection

Sleep hours, REM %, deep sleep %, interruptions, stress level, caffeine, screen time.

Pattern Recognition

Maps sleep data to past decision outcomes.

Prediction Engine

Forecasts decision readiness using ML (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).

Output

Actionable insights like:

🧮 Analytical → Best at 10–11 AM

🎨 Creative → Strong at 9–11 AM

❤️ Emotional → Avoid before 2 PM

💰 Financial → Peak after 3 PM

📊 Features

Predicts cognitive performance windows for different decision types.

Generates daily cognitive weather forecast.

Provides visual reports and charts.

Personalized → Learns user-specific patterns over time.
